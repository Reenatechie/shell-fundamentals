Iâ€™ve created a simple Bash script called todo.sh that functions as a command-line To-Do List manager. The script displays a menu with four options:

View all tasks

Add a new task

Delete a task

Exit

When a user selects an option, the script performs the corresponding action. Tasks are stored temporarily (likely using an array or file), and users can add or remove tasks by number. I made the script executable using chmod +x and ran it with ./todo.sh. This project shows my ability to handle user input, control flow, and basic file or list operations in Bash.
